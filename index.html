                                            ECVET combines several technical components and processes into a <b>methodological framework</b> that forms the <a href="http://www.ecvet-team.eu/en/ecvet-system" target="_blank"><i>ECVET system</i></a>. The general objectives of ECVET are targeted towards vocational training activities, facilitating transnational mobility and lifelong learning for all. The main challenge for the introduction of a common methodological framework like ECVET in the European VET environment is the <b>broad range of bodies</b> involved with the different functions of qualifications systems.

A VET Learner in the context of ECVET is therefore an adult person who is interested in participating in vocational education training activities in order to achieve certain learning outcomes and acquire a certified set of competences and skills.

                                    <p>ECVET Capability Maturity Framework (ECVET CMF) has been designed to allow VET related organisations and individual actors across Europe, to understand and reap the benefits of ECVET from their perspective as well as to track their performance and to assure and control the quality of the integration of the ECVET system into their existing processes and workflows.</p>
                                    <p>ECVET CMF is an adaptation of the well-known <b>Capability Maturity Model (CMM)</b> which was originally applied to software development and has subsequently been developed into the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and applied to other areas of business activity.</p>

Each maturity level matures an important subset of the organisation’s processes, preparing it to move to the next maturity level.

                                                    Level 2 contains a set of initial practices. To achieve level 2, these initial activities may be performed in an ad hoc manner, but they must be performed. If a competent organization were to start with no capability in managing ECVET, it should focus initially on implementing the Level 2 practices.
                                                    <br /> Thus, Level 2 is characterized by a single management goal:</p>

With experienced and talented personnel, high-quality outcomes may be achieved even if practices are ad hoc. However, at this level, lessons learned are typically not captured at the organizational level, so approaches and outcomes are difficult to repeat or improve across the organization.

                                            At the Initial Level of ECVET CMF, the organization typically does not provide a stable environment for developing and maintaining vocational training activities based on the ECVET framework.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />Such organisations frequently have difficulty making commitments that the staff can meet with an orderly process, resulting in a series of issues and, probably, crises. During a crisis, the ECVET programmes typically abandon planned procedures and revert to adhoc activities. Success depends entirely on having exceptional managers, trainers, support staff and, last but not least, self-determined learners. Occasionally, capable and forceful trainers and teams can withstand the pressures to take shortcuts in the training process; but when they leave the programme, their stabilizing influence leaves with them.
                                            <br />
                                            <br /> Even an otherwise strong training programme, cannot overcome the instability created by the absence of sound processes. In spite of this ad hoc, even chaotic, process, Level 1 organizations frequently develop training activities that work, even though they may be over the budget, out of schedule and uder-reported. Success in Level 1 organisations depends on the competence and heroics of the people in the organisation and cannot be repeated unless the same competent individuals are assigned to the next training programme. Thus, at Level 1, capability is a characteristic of the individuals, not of the organisation.

                                        <br /> VET programmes in Level 2 organisations have installed basic project management controls. Realistic commitments are based on the results observed on previous programmes and on the requirements of the current programme. The managers for a programme track performance of the trainee, the trainers, schedules, and functionality; problems in meeting commitments are identified when they arise. Expected learning outcomes and the training activities perform to satisfy them are baselined, and their integrity is controlled. The competent organisations overlook and manage their liaisons in real-work environments, where some training activities make take place.

                                        <br /> Processes may differ between programmes in a Level 2 organisation. The organisational requirement for achieving Level 2 is that there are policies that guide the programmes in establishing the appropriate processes. The ECVET process capability of Level 2 organisations can be summarized as disciplined because planning and tracking of each VET programme is stable and earlier successes can be repeated. The overall ECVET programme and its associated training activities are under the effective control of a project management system, following realistic plans based on the performance of previous pogrammes.

All programmes use an approved, tailored version of this organisation-wide process for VET actions.
                                    </p>

                                        At the Defined Level, the standard process for developing and implementing ECVET programmes across the organization is documented, including both training and management processes, and these processes are integrated into a coherent whole. This standard process is referred to throughout the ECVET CMF as the organisation-wide ECVET process. Processes established at Level 3 are used (and changed, as appropriate) to help the trainers, the managers and support staff perform more effectively. The organisation exploits effective practices when standardizing its processes and there is a group that is responsible for the organisation's process documentation and tracking, e.g., an ECVET process group. An organization-wide training program is implemented to ensure that the staff, trainers and managers have the knowledge and skills required to fulfill their assigned roles.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> Projects tailor the organization's standard software process to develop their own defined software process, which accounts for the unique characteristics of the project. This tailored process is referred to in the CMM as the project's defined software process. A defined software process contains a coherent, integrated set of well-defined software engineering and management processes. A well-defined process can be characterized as including readiness criteria, inputs, standards and procedures for performing the work, verification mechanisms (such as peer reviews), outputs, and completion criteria. Because the software process is well defined, management has good insight into technical progress on all projects.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> The ECVET process capability of Level 3 organisations can be summarized as standard and consistent because both training and management activities are stable and repeatable. Within established training activites, cost, schedule, and functionality are under control, and overall training quality is tracked and reported. This process capability is based on a common, organisation-wide understanding of the activities, roles, and responsibilities in a defined ECVET process.

                                        At the Managed Level, the organisation sets quantitative quality goals for both training programmes and processes. Productivity and quality are measured for important ECVET process activities across all programmes as part of an organisational measurement framework. An organization-wide ECVET programme database is used to collect and analyze the data available from the programmes' defined ECVET processes. ECVET processes are instrumented with well-defined and consistent measurements at Level 4. These measurements establish the quantitative foundation for evaluating the programmes' training processes and performance.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> Programmes achieve control over their training activities and processes by narrowing the variation in their process performance to fall within acceptable quantitative boundaries. Meaningful variations in process performance can be distinguished from random variation (noise), particularly within established training programmes. The risks involved in moving up the learning curve of a new application domain are known and carefully managed.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> The ECVET process capability of Level 4 organizations can be summarized as being quantifiable and predictable because the process is measured and operates within measurable limits. This level of process capability allows an organization to predict trends in process and overall training quality within the quantitative bounds of these limits. Because the process is both stable and measured, when some exceptional circumstance occurs, the “special cause” of the variation can be identified and addressed. When the known limits of the process are exceeded, action is taken to correct the situation. ECVET programmes are of predictably high quality.

                                        At the Optimising Level, the entire organization is focused on continuous process improvement. The organisation has the means to identify weaknesses and strengthen the process proactively, with the goal of preventing the occurrence of defects. Data on the effectiveness of the ECVET process is used to perform cost-benefit analyses of new techniques, standards, and technologies and consult changes to the organisation-wide ECVET process. Innovations that exploit the best practices are identified and transferred throughout the organization.

Processes are evaluated to prevent known types of defects from recurring, and lessons learned are disseminated to other programmes. There is chronic waste, in the form of rework, in any system simply due to random variation. Waste is unacceptable; organised efforts to remove waste result in changing the system, i.e., improving the process by changing “common causes” of inefficiency to prevent the waste from occurring. While this is true of all the maturity levels, it is the focus of Level 5.

                                        <br> The software process capability of Level 5 organisations can be characterized as continuously improving because Level 5 organisations are continuously striving to improve the range of their process capability, thereby improving the process performance of their ECVET programmes. Improvement occurs both by incremental advancements in the existing process and by innovations using new training techniques, approaches, emerging technologies, standards and methods. Technology and process improvements are planned and managed as ordinary training activities.

                                        <p>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the US Department of Defence and operated by Carnegie Mellon University, developed the original capability maturity model - SW-CMM, Capability Maturity Model for Software - in the early 1990s, which is still widely used today. Capability maturity models have gained widescale acceptance over the last decade. These models and their associated methods were originally applied to IT solutions, particularly software solutions, but a number of IT-related disciplines have developed capability maturity models to support process improvement in areas such as:</p>

                                        <p>The models have been adopted by large organizations, including the US Department of Commerce, the US DoD, the UK Government, and a number of large services organizations, to assess competencies. As an example of the trend towards increased interest in applying capability maturity model techniques to IT architecture, all US federal agencies are now expected to provide maturity models and ratings as part of their IT investment management and audit requirements. In particular, the US Department of Commerce (DoC) has developed an IT Architecture Capability Maturity Model (ACMM)2 to aid in conducting internal assessments. The ACMM provides a framework that represents the key components of a productive IT architecture process. The goal is to enhance the overall odds for success of IT architecture by identifying weak areas and providing a defined evolutionary path to improving the overall architecture process. The rationale of all of these models are to facilitate the introduction of a process improvement methodology, which aims to take projects, teams and organisations from the 1st “chaotic” or “initial” level, to a higher level, ideally but not necessarily level 5, "optimising".

                                            <br />Skipping levels is counter-productive because each level forms a necessary foundation from which to achieve the next level. The models identify the levels through which an organization must evolve to establish a culture of excellence in the related domain. Processes without the proper foundation fail at the very point they are needed most – under stress – and they provide no basis for future improvemen
